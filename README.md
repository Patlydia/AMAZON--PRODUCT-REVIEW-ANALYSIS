##Insight from the analysis
PRODUCT IMPROVEMENT
i.HIGH RATING BUT LOW REVIEW COUNT: In task 6 ( Chart 3), some products has very few reviews with with high level of rating. More promotional campaigns  should be done for the products in order to  increase  customer review.
ii.LOW DISCOUNT CATEGORIES: In task 1( Chart 1),category like Books , with consistencly 0% average discount may not sell well due to lack of customer incentives. Consider subsequent discounts in oerder to engage customers.
iii.PRODUCT WITH LOWER RATINGS BUT HIGH RATING COUNT: In the case of task 4(Chart 2), any product that has many reviews with average rating below 3.5 indicates dissatisfaction. Users complaint should be investigated in order to know the problem and improve product quality.

MARKETING STRATEGIES
i.TOP 5 PRODUCTS BY RATING AND REVIEWS: Use the top 5  products as in task 14( Chart 9) as the principal items in promotion, as they are already know and  trusted.
ii.CATEGORY WITH HIGH POTENTIAL REVENUE: In task 9(Chart 6), category like Electronicsgenerates the highest potential revenue. Focus  more marketing budget  on these categories with targeted campaigns.
iii.EFFECTIVE DISCOUNT BOUNDARIES: Products with greater than or equal to 50% may be  resulting to more engagement .Structured discount advertisment may be considered during sales season for selected categories. as seen in task 7( Chart 4).

CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT
i.CORRELATION BETWEEN DISCOUNT AND RATING: The relationship between discount and rating is weak as in task 11( Chart 7), which means that discount alone do not  increase satisfaction. You can invest more in improving delivery quality and product experience.
ii.ANALYSIS OF RATING DISTRIBUTION:In task 8(Chart 6),if most products  are rated  4.0 and above. You can maintain this by  encouraging  trusted and verified customers to  always  put down their  follow up emails or contact after purchse has been made.
iii.LOW REVIEW COUNT PRODUCTS: Information from task 12(chart 8), products with less than 1000 reviews may be improved from automated review review request or incentive feedback.
